      <a href="index.html">MISS_HIT</a> includes a simple tool
      (<span class="file">mh_trace</span>), that can be used to
      extract tracing tags for code and tests. The output is json and
      is intended to be used by other tools.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div>
        Tracing your code and tests to your requirements and
        specification is a common activity when developing to safety
        standards (such as ISO 26262 or DO-178C). While you definitely
        should not be using MATLAB for this, it is not my place to
        judge; and so we have a tool to support this
        activity. <tt>mh_trace</tt> can extract tags put in code and
        test and generate an easy to parse json file that a different
        tool can use to generate a traceability report.
      </div>

      <div>
        The MATLAB language already includes some features
        (<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/tag-unit-tests.html">TestTags</a>)
        to help you annotate tests; consider this example (taken from
        the MathWorks website):
      </div>
      <div>
<pre>
classdef (TestTags = {'FeatureB'}) ...
        ExampleTagClassTest < matlab.unittest.TestCase
    methods (Test)
        function testF (testCase)
            % test code
        end
    end
    methods (Test, TestTags = {'FeatureC','System'})
        function testG (testCase)
            % test code
        end
    end
    methods (Test, TestTags = {'System','FeatureA'})
        function testH (testCase)
            % test code
        end
    end
end
</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
        Running <tt>mh_trace</tt> will generate a json file (by
        default <tt>mh_trace.json</tt>) that shows which tags affect
        any given function:
<pre>
{
    "ExampleTagClassTest::testF": {
        "source": {
            "col_start": 17,
            "filename": "ExampleTagClassTest.m",
            "line": 6
        },
        "tags": ["FeatureB"],
        "test": True
    },
    "ExampleTagClassTest::testG": {
        "source": {
            "col_start": 17,
            "filename": "ExampleTagClassTest.m",
            "line": 11
        },
        "tags": ["FeatureB", "FeatureC", "System"],
        "test": True
    },
    "ExampleTagClassTest::testH": {
        "source": {
            "col_start": 17,
            "filename": "ExampleTagClassTest.m",
            "line": 16
        },
        "tags": ["FeatureA", "FeatureB", "System"],
        "test": True
    }
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        You can also generate the tracing information by tag (using
        the <tt>--by-tag</tt> option):
<pre>
{
    "FeatureA": [
        {
            "name": "ExampleTagClassTest::testH",
            "source": {
                "col_start": 17,
                "filename": "ExampleTagClassTest.m",
                "line": 16
            },
            "test": True
        }
    ],
    "FeatureB": [
        {
            "name": "ExampleTagClassTest::testF",
            "source": {
                "col_start": 17,
                "filename": "ExampleTagClassTest.m",
                "line": 6
            },
            "test": True
        },
</pre>
        (The rest is omitted because it's just more of the same...)
      </div>

      <div>
        If you use project configuration (libraries and entrypoints)
        then an additional field is present in the json output -
        "shared" to indicate if this code belongs to a shared library
        or if it is part of an entry point.
      </div>

      <h3>Annotating code</h3>
      <div>
        While TestTags can be used to annotate tests, it cannot be
        used to annotate code. To trace code, MISS_HIT supports a
        special pragma:
        <pre>%| pragma Tag("potato-req-1");</pre>
        You can also give more than one tag in a single Tag pragma:
        <pre>%| pragma Tag("potato-req-1", "kitten-req-42");</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
        Pragma tag applies to all items scoped logically under the
        entity that is tagged. For example placing the Tag pragma in a
        class definition will affect all methods; placing it in a
        function will also affect all nested functions; and placing it
        in a compilation unit will affect all functions or methods in
        that compilation unit.
      </div>
      <div>
        Note: this pragma can also be used to tag tests. There is no
        difference between using this pragma and adding a TestTags
        property to tests.
      </div>

      <h3>Excluding code</h3>
      <div>
        Most projects have some code for e.g. setting up the workspace
        or build scripts. This code is not part of the delivery and so
        should not make it into the requirements traceability report;
        it can be excluded using the <tt>No_Tracing</tt> pragma:

        <pre>%| pragma No_Tracing;</pre>

        This pragma has identical scoping rules as pragma Tag, and
        completely removes the affected functions from the json
        output. If you place it at the top of a file, it excludes all
        functions in that compilation unit. If a function is affected
        by both Tags and a No_Tracing pragma then the No_Tracing
        pragma takes precedence.
      </div>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Command-line interface</h2>
      <h4>--json FILE</h4>
      <div>
        By default we produce a file
        called <tt>mh_trace.json</tt>. With this option you can change
        the filename.
      </div>

      <h4>--by-tag</h4>
      <div>
        Produce tracing by-tag, instead of by-file (the default).
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <div>
        The tool will only extrac tags from the files that MISS_HIT
        normally processes. So if you have your unit tests excluded
        from MISS_HIT then you will get no tracing. You could use the
        common <tt>--ignore-config</tt> option to work around this; or
        even better: don't exclude your unit tests.
