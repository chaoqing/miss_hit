# Language translator from MATLAB to Python

This package provides a utility `mh_python` to translate MATLAB into Python format while keeping most of the MATLAB accent.
The generated Python code hope to be directly runnable with the [mat2py](https://mat2py.org) framework.

This `mh_python` utility was initially developed under fork of [MISS_HIT](https://github.com/florianschanda/miss_hit) and
then exported to a seperated [branch](https://github.com/mat2py/miss_hit/tree/mh_python) for uploading to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mh-python/).
